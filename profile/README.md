Search is evolving. Customers now use ChatGPT and other AI platforms to discover businesses. Staying on top of SEO, AI platform optimization, and algorithm updates is overwhelming and not what business owners signed up for. Reach, an AI agent, handles all of this automatically.

We learned about SEO and AI search the hard way
After building our first business (Rely.io) and going through Techstars NYC, we learned from some of the world's best SEO experts about improving search results through keyword research, content optimization, technical fixes, and link building. However, time constraints made it difficult to focus on both SEO and business growth.

When I started doing AI consulting, I decided to try something different. I built an AI agent to handle search optimization while I served clients. This solution yielded immediate results: improved search visibility, increased leads, and reduced time spent on SEO. The agent’s capabilities attracted overwhelming demand, prompting us to realize that this problem affected many business owners and should be addressed collectively.


## 🛡️ Enterprise-Grade: Secure, Compliant, and Open

We understand the critical importance of security and control for enterprises:

*   🔒 **Enforce Data Privacy:** We build self-hostable AI agents that prioritize your data's privacy by default. Expect secure container access and VPC peering, with no external data sharing unless explicitly configured by you.
*   📜 **Meet Regulatory Compliance:** Our solutions are built with rigorous security controls and documentation designed to meet stringent requirements like SOC-2. From Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and audit trails to end-to-end encryption, we adhere to the highest standards.
*   🌍 **Open-Source First:** We leverage community-vetted, open-source components. This gives you full transparency, avoids vendor lock-in, and provides the freedom to customize everything to your specific needs.
